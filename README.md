# Are you in Oahu?

## Overview

We want more information about temperature trends before opening our surf shop. Specifically, we want temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

These are the sumamry results for June and December on Oahu.

We can note a few conclusions here

* The AVERAGE temperatures for June and December are remarkable close. Within 4 degrees of eachother
* The MAX temperature for the years recorded were even closer. Within 2 degrees of eachother
* The STD DEV for December is larger, indicating larger swings hot and cold

## Summary

As we can see the weather in Oahu, Hawaii is temperate year round. On the top level, if you are able to have ice cream and surf in June, it sure looks like you can do it in December too. With average temperatures of 75F/71F and similar median temperatures we can see there is little fluctuation. While the highs are remarkable similar at 85F for June and 83F for December respectively, the lows are a little lower in December at 56F versus 64 in June. 

Wetsuits and raincoats should be all customers need.... unless we discover more!

Some additional querries I would run are:

* Precipitation by Month: Are there wetter times? DO people surf more or eat less icecream when it rains more? We could dive into the data to find that out.
* Temperature by Station by Month: If we can assign a location to each station maybe we can figure out which station and by extension which side of the island is warmer or colder, wetter or drier, less ectreme season to season...etc.
